## Description

The Vi500 4-1S-1V Triblock by ViMEG is a fully automatic bottle rinsing and filling machine with two capping heads for Wine Corks and ROPP Screw Caps, but retains the footprint just slightly larger than a monoblock. The Vi500 4-1S-1V has a production rate of 200–600 bottles per hour. The self-contained unit is complete with load and unload trays, chain conveyor, filling hopper, cork hopper with loading arm & corking head, ROPP cap hopper with loading arm & capping head, motor, and on-board touch screen control unit to operate the machine.

The conveyor smoothly carries the bottles to the filling station, where the nozzles are automatically lowered into the bottles, creating an air-tight seal to fill the bottles whilst purging the oxygen. Once filled the bottles are automatically transferred to the dual capping stations via conveyor where optical sensors are used to ensure each bottle opening is correctly aligned for precise application of the cork or cap. Each capping and corking station has its own hopper and feeding arm. The descending track contains a photocell sensor to ensure the presence of a cork/cap in the feed channel. The machine is outfitted with an on-board compressor, as both heads incorporate vacuum prior to inserting the cork/applying the screw cap. The PLC control unit with on-board variable frequency drive allows you to adjust the speed of operation as well as set & save preset configurations, keep track of the bottle count, and perform diagnostics.

The optional 2-Nozzle Rinsing & Drying Kit can be used to quickly sanitize or rinse and dry bottles prior to placing them on the conveyor.
