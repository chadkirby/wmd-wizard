## Description

The Tenco Rotary Monobloc for Pouch Filling & Capping (through the spout filling) is a fully automated machine for viscous or liquid/semi-liquid products. This automated machine uses a pneumatic volumetric piston filler to fill pouches (optional electronic dosing system). Following the filling of the pouch, a hopper/feeder releases the caps which are then installed by an automated closing head.

This Rotary Monobloc has an output of 900 – 1,200 Pouches Per Hour (1-Nozzle & 1-Capper) or 1,800 - 2,400 PPH (2-Nozzles & 2-Cappers), and has an optional upgrade to add Nitrogen and Lot/Date Printing.

The filling process is completed by means of a Pneumatic Piston or Electronic Dosing System, which has a 20-1300ml dosing range. This machine is used for filling products such as: Chemicals, Cleaners, Olive Oil, Cosmetics, Lotions, Sauces, Creams, Apple Sauce, and other viscous or liquid products. All parts in contact with the product are made of AISI 316 Stainless Steel and the seals are made of PTFE, FKM, or food-grade silicone.

The types of pouches that this machine works with are spouted pouches, stand-up pouches, Doypack pouches, flexible pouches, or any other pouch with an already existing spout.
