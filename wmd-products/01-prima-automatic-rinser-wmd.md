## Description

The PRIMA S Single-Station Rinser by ViMEG is a fully automatic bottle rinsing machine. A small amount of liquid (filtered water or no-rinse sanitizer) is sprayed into the bottles before they are swung vertical and rotated to ensure that they are uniformly cleaned and dried before moving on to the next stage in the bottling process.

The PRIMA S can be produced with 9, 12, 16, 20 or 24 rinsing nozzles, providing a production rate of 800 - 6000 bottles per hour. The self-contained unit is complete with its own conveyer belt for loading and unloading bottles, filling hopper, cork hopper with loading arm for the corks, single corking head, motor, and on-board control unit for operating the machine and adjusting the production speed. The in-feed screw smoothly transitions the bottles from the conveyor to the revolving starwheel where they are precisely positioned atop automatic lift plates that raise the bottles to the filling nozzles. The subsequent revolving starwheel secures the base of the bottle at the point of corking, while individual microsensors ensure that the bottle opening is correctly aligned for precise application of the cork. The on-board variable frequency digital control allows you to adjust the speed of the conveyor and rinsing nozzles.

The PRIMA S is modular and can be operated as a stand-alone unit or in a fully-integrated series with other ViMEG machines.
