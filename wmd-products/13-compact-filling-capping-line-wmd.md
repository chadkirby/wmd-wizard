## Description

This Compact Monoblock Filler and Capping Line is an automatic volumetric filling and capping machine. The unit is intended for filling glass or plastic bottles with liquid or viscous products by means of piston filler(s). An eight position star-wheel rotates bottles through the Filling and Capping stations, where caps are fed from a vibrating sorting hopper then applied to the bottle. The cap tightening is performed by a hysteresis magnetic clutch with a custom made stainless steel chuck. All components of the unit can be accessed via front and back doors with automatic close sensors.
